## Security

Local Trader uses secure <b>Oauth2 authentication</b> for the LocalBitcoins services. 

For authentication you will be taken to the LocalBitcoins website where you will need to authenticate as you would when logging into LocalBitcoins. Upon successful authentication you will be returned to the Local Trader application.

Local Trader request permissions for read, write and money_pin during authentication. The money_pin permission allows you to send money using your <b>LocalBitcoins PIN code</b>.

You created a PIN code as part of the LocalBitcoins registration and it is required to send Bitcoin from your wallet, and to fund or release trades. The PIN code is <b>NOT</b> the same as your 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).  

View or manage your PIN code from your [profile page](https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/#toc6?ch=2hbo) or use the [mirror site profile page](https://localbitcoins.net/accounts/profile/#toc6?ch=2hbo) for blocked regions.

To build Local Trader from code you need Android Studio 3.0 installed.  Check out the code from Github.  You need to modifiy your local.properties file to contain your own LocalBitcions API key and secret from [LocalBitcoins API page](https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/api/). Append your values to the end of the local.poperties file:

```
lbcAccessKey=[your_api_key]

```
